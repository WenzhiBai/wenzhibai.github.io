I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Manchester</a>, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TxurO5wAAAAJ" target="_blank">Dr. Zhenhong Li</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ntgRzlYAAAAJ" target="_blank">Prof. Andrew Weightman</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZVb3sOQAAAAJ" target="_blank">Prof. Zhengtao Ding</a>. Prior to beginning my Ph.D. journey in 2024, I accumulated several years of professional experience in autonomous mobile robots, with a particular focus on SLAM research, at <a href="https://www.ldrobot.com/" target="_blank">LDROBOT</a> and <a href="https://www.apollo.auto/" target="_blank">BAIDU Apollo</a> in succession, from 2017. I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation and M.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering in 2014 and 2017, respectively, both from the <a href="https://english.hust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a> in China.

My research interests include autonomous mobile robots and surgical robots, with a focus on sensor fusion, localisation and mapping, and state estimation in real-world environments. Recently, my work has centred on the perception and manipulation of deformable objects, addressing challenges in medical contexts.
